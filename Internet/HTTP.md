| HTTP | The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a TCP/IP-based application layer communication protocol that standardizes how clients and servers communicate with each other. | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP </br> https://cs.fyi/guide/http-in-depth </br> https://http.dev/explained |
| Application Layer | An application layer is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communication protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a communications network. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer |
| Client | The client identifies itself with the user-agent, which is any tool that makes requests for the benefit of the user. | https://http.dev/explained | 
| Server | The web server is the entity that serves the documents, or resources, that are requested by the client. | https://http.dev/explained |
| Proxy server | Proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource. Proxy servers will perform Caching, load-balancing, filtering, logging, and Authentication. | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server |
| HTTP session | HTTP session is a temporary information exchange between a server and a client. It is a sequence of network request-response transactions that are initiated by the client using TCP or an alternative protocol on a specific port. | https://http.dev/session | 
| Request | Requests include a keyword, or method, that specifies what operation is to be performed. A common method is HTTP GET, which can often be used to retrieve a specific resource. Requests can include the path of the resource, the version of the HTTP protocol being used, various HTTP Headers used to supply the server with additional information, and a message body for transmitting bulk content. A message body can be used by a method such as HTTP POST, where the content will be stored on the server for consumption at a later time or by another client. | https://http.dev/explained |
| Response | Responses are sent by servers as answers to requests. These include some of the same information that a request does, such as the HTTP protocol version, but also contain details such as a status code to indicate success, failure, and the reasons why. | https://http.dev/explained | 
| HTTP headers | HTTP headers are a means for a client, server, and any intermediaries to exchange information during the HTTP request-response process. | https://http.dev/headers |
