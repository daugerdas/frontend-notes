| Hex notation | Hexadecimal notation (often shortened to hex) is a shorthand syntax for RGB. The hexadecimal ranges are 0-9 and A-F. When used in a six digit sequence, they are translated to the RGB numerical ranges which are 0-255 which correspond to the red, green, and blue color channels respectively. | https://web.dev/learn/css/color/ |
| RGB |  RGB (Red, Green, Blue) colors are defined with the rgb() color function, using either numbers or percentages as parameters. The numbers need to be within the 0-255 range and the percentages are between 0% and 100%â€Œ. | https://web.dev/learn/css/color/ |
| HSL | HSL stands for hue, saturation and lightness. Hue describes the value on the color wheel, from 0 to 360 degrees, starting with red (being both 0 and 360). A hue of 180, or 50% would be in the blue range. Saturation is how vibrant the selected hue is. A fully desaturated color (with a saturation of 0%) will appear grayscale. And finally, lightness is the parameter which describes the scale from white to black of added light. A lightness of 100% will always give you white. | https://web.dev/learn/css/color/ |
