## Introduction
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

### Just-in-time
In computing, just-in-time (JIT) compilation (also dynamic translation or run-time compilations) is a way of executing computer code that involves compilation during execution of a program (at run time) rather than before execution.

### First-class functions
A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

### Prototype-based programming

Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which classes are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object.
In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an object without first defining its class.
