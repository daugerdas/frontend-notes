# frontendintro.com 

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ \
frontendintro.com is a work in progress project that aims to present notes for those that are starting to learn frontend development. Currently all information is in github and markdown files, but there is a plan to have a separate website for this. You're very welcome to contribute!
